# FunctionalProgrammingExample
Practical excercise of functional programming in Java.

Suppose that we have a list of objects with the following attributes: name, cost, category, and stock. We want to make the following operations using the Stream API:


Get a list of all the products with a stock greater than 0 and a cost lower than 50.
Get a list of the names of all the products that fall under the category "groceries".
Get the total cost of the products.
Products to add:
add(new Product("Rice", 30.5, "Groceries", 50));
add(new Product("Milk", 20.0, "Groceries", 0));
add(new Product("Laptop", 1500.0, "Electronics ", 10));
add(new Product("TV", 800.0, "Electronics", 5));
add(new Product("Table", 120.0, "Furniture", 15));
